# Rainbow Facilities App
This is an Android/Java app made for CREATICA2020. We didn't win but we feel this is extremely important for our resumes and to keep this repository public.

# ABOUT
This was Sandhya's idea - what if - we had an idea to make it easier for trans people to find bathrooms and other places where they can be safe? And not be harmed or harassed?
This is where our app comes into play. We enabled features where you can search by ZIP Code, Address, and asked location and see where the safest places are for you as a trans or
non binary person to be.

# WHAT We Used
Java, Android Studio, Figma, iMovie, Git, Github
